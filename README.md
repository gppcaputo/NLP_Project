Italia POS tagger
This work aims to develop an application for part-of-speech tagging in the Italian language
using a DNN (Deep Neural Network) approach, specifically utilizing the tagged dataset from
EVALITA 2007. Part-of-speech tagging plays a crucial role in linguistic analysis and natural
language processing tasks by assigning grammatical tags to each word in a given text. Accurate
and efficient tagging of Italian words enables users to analyze and process Italian text with
enhanced linguistic understanding.
The EVALITA 2007 tagging dataset was used as the basis for the training, model evaluation and evaluation part.
It comprises a large collection of Italian text samples, manually annotated
with the corresponding part-of-speech tags. The composition of the dataset includes a variety of
textual genres, domains and linguistic complexities that make it suitable to capture the nuances
and diversity of the Italian language. Prior to training the model, the dataset underwent preprocessing
steps to ensure data integrity and consistency.
In selecting the DNN approach for part-of-speech tagging, an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
architecture was specifically chosen due to its superior performance in sequence labeling
tasks. RNNs have the inherent ability to model sequential dependencies and capture contextual
information by considering the preceding words in a sentence. This makes them particularly
well-suited for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, where the grammatical role of a word is often
influenced by its neighboring words. By leveraging the power of RNNs, the developed application
achieves enhanced accuracy and linguistic understanding in part-of-speech tagging for the
Italian language.
